## FAQ

<details>
<summary>What is FTFC (Full Time Frame Continuity)?</summary>

FTFC is a principle / concept of [#TheStrat](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TheStrat). If you've never heard of it before, start with the following article.

<summary>Why is a time frame box dark?</summary>

If you are seeing dark boxes like this:

It's because the time interval isn't supplying enough historical time data to properly calculate continuity. You need to adjust the time interval to give it more data.

## Credit / Inspiration

The [first version](http://tos.mx/TNPBVJ6) I came across was created by [@mm](https://twitter.com/mm). However, it came with a "‚ö†Ô∏è Complex script, you may experience greater load times." warning inside of TOS and it wasn't kidding! It would cause my laptop fans to sound like a jet engines and it sent my laptop temperature to climb to very dangerous levels.

The [next version](https://tos.mx/JZROQzW) I came across was created by [@pelonsax](https://twitter.com/pelonsax). The code was less complex, but it was visually too busy for me and could be even more performant.
